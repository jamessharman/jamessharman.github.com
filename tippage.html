Tips:
<br>
<br>
<ul id="tips">
<li> When you press start, you will be taken to screen with six pages.
<li> Each page contains an image and clues to a separate page with an mp3 file on it, which can be downloaded by right clicking and selecting "save as" or "save target as". Finding the link is the trick.
<li> You may need to manually enter the link in the address bar once you have found it.
<li> If the answer is to enter a url, it will always end with ".html".
<li> The clues maybe reasonably straight forward, or relatively vague.
<li> The clue might be hidden as well.
<li> There may be more than one clue.
<li> The image may be there to help or distract you.
<li> When you want to put together the mp3 files you have, use Audacity. It is a free piece of audio editing software. All you have to do is drag each mp3 file into Audacity and press play. It can be found <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">here.</a>
